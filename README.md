# Description:
Our site allows users to browse UFO reports in the United States ranging from over 100 years ago to the present day. Using a drop down menu on the main page, users will be able to select a time interval to filter the reports by (day/month/year/decade). Users will then be able to interact with a slider that moves by their selected time interval. A map of the United States on the main page will indicate reports by displaying dots on their respective locations. Users will be able to hover over the dots to view specific information about the UFO report.
